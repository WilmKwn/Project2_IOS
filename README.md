## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Since I am using a Virtual Machine on Windows 11, the macOS virtual machine was very tricky to setup and is extremely slow and laggy to efficient work. 
Additionally, the table view layout troubled me for a while; however, I went back to the labs and tutorials and figured it out in the end.
